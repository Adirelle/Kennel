Kennel is a simple minipet addon, it automatically puts out a random pet
whenever you need one.  Kennel will not put out your pet if you are stealthed,
mounted, flying, moving, casting, in an arena or BG.  Kennel will also avoid
putting out a pet in certain subzones where a quest summons a pet for you.
